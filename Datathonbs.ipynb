Refugees are seen either as victims or aggressors to be kept out. Yet there are groups of refugees who have trumped the odds. In this series, we feature an earlier wave of refugees who haven’t just survived, but are thriving today and giving back to their communities. Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence. This series proves that food can truly break down walls, and help us find the commonality across different people.',\n",

Dongo historically belongs to the Lobala, but over the years, the Boba have increasingly begun to control the town economically and through political aspirations. While the growing marginalization of the Lobala is what ultimately led to an armed rebellion against the Boba in 2009, this larger conflict was sparked by localized tensions over access to fishing ponds between two ethnic groups, the Inyelle and the Manzaya, whose grievances date back to the 1940s.\n",

      "Over the past few years, the issue of refugees has become highly politicised. Refugees are seen either as victims or aggressors to be kept out. Yet there are groups of refugees who have trumped the odds. In this series, we feature an earlier wave of refugees who haven’t just survived, but are thriving today and giving back to their communities. Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence. This series proves that food can truly break down walls, and help us find the commonality across different people.\n",

      "Text: Visiting unique sites for work is de rigueur for architects, but how many can say they have trekked the Himalayas as research? This is what Goy Zhenru did in 2023 after her firm Goy Architects was engaged to refurbish the iconic Hotel Everest View – the only hotel in the world’s highest mountain range where every guestroom has a view of Mount Everest and neighbouring alabaster peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had received a call from Sonia Miyahara asking if we would like to work on the hotel’s refurbishment. I immediately jumped and said yes to a Zoom call,” recalled Goy. Nepali architect Manish Kayastha had seen one of her projects in a magazine and recommended the firm to Miyahara. Hotel Everest View was developed in the 1970s by Miyahara’s father, the late Takashi Miyahara and designed by Japanese architect Yoshinobu Kumagaya. It is situated on Syangboche in the Kumbu region of Nepal, within the Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park – a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hotel offers 360-degree views of the Himalayas mountain range that includes Mount Everest at 8,848m above sea level. Miyahara, who previously worked in Singapore, had returned to Nepal to help with the family business. It was her aspiration to make Hotel Everest View one of the best mountain hotels in the world,” shared Goy.\n",

The advantage of balancing these portfolios is that “you don’t have to fight, which takes up a lot of time and energy,” he joked. But it’s not quite an unusual role, he added. “Historically, the longevity and success of jewellery or luxury companies are always associated with balancing creativity and business. If you are super creative, but with no business sense, you usually don’t last for a long time. And if you have good business sense but no creativity, you don’t have something exciting to offer to your customers.”\n",

      "Text: This week hundreds of people – from villagers to friends and a former prime minister – gathered in the isolated green hills of his homeland to remember Leahy. The week-long celebration began upon a tribal ceremonial ground beside a Pentecostal church nestled among thousands of coffee trees, grass huts and plantation sheds, cradled by jagged mountains. A man clutched a totem-like structure – known as a paga – a single wooden pole that displayed a dark suit jacket, white shirt, tie and a framed photograph of the late Leahy. His sons, Jim and Michael, along with Ganiga elders watched as the paga was stuck into the ground. About 100 Ganiga tribesmen and women, smeared in white clay in honour of the dead, performed the traditional paga romp ceremony to welcome mourners.

It formed the final day of the customary haus krai, a traditional ceremony held in Papua New Guinea to honour a life.\n",
